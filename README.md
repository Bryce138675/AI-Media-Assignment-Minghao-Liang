# AI-Media-Assignment-Minghao-Liang

1. Assignment1:

At first, I chose images as my dataset and I downloaded over two hundred of them. Then when I did my mini project, I downloaded music as my dataset. However, as the music dataset is too large, I randomly selected two songs from each group in the dataset (14 songs in total) and uploaded them all to https://artslondon- my.sharepoint.com/personal/m_liang0620221_arts_ac_uk/_layouts/15/one drive.aspx?view=0.

2. Assignment2:

I writed a datasheet for the dataset you created for assignment 1.

A datasheet for a dataset is a formal document that is used to documents the motivation. for creating a dataset, it's composition, collection process and recommended uses.

3. Assignment3:

I extended the model in this notebook into one which maps (X,Y) -> (R,G,B).

I added at least 2 more layers to the network.

I experimented with alternative activation functions and optimizers. I described how the image we have created differs from a normal image.
